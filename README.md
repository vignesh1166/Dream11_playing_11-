### In the Dream11 project, I meticulously analyzed data related to cricket matches, particularly focusing on player performances. Your analysis involved studying key datasets like deliveries.csv and matches.csv, which likely contained details about deliveries, matches, runs scored, and other performance metrics.

### The goal of the project was to curate a top-performing playing 11 team for Dream11 fantasy cricket. This involved comprehensive data analysis to determine the most promising players based on their past performance, runs scored, wickets taken, and other relevant statistics. I employed various statistical and analytical techniques to derive insights and identify optimal player combinations for the Dream11 team.
